# ShareMe
In this task, you need to develop the data access layer of the blog for the ShareMe startup. Currently, the company doesn't have a well-drafted plan of how the website should work and look like. You will have to be content with only thumbnails of some pages.
## Requirements
* .NET Fundamentals
* .NET LINQ
* .NET ORM
* Code style
* Consider the website mockups: page 1, page 2 and page 3.
* Create commands and queries that the system will use for interacting with the database.
* Create console, mobile, desktop or web application to demonstrate how the data access level works with the database.
## Advanced Requirements
* The application should create the database if it does not exist.
